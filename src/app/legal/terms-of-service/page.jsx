                  without disruption and is available to the greatest extent
                  possible, but we point out that complete and uninterrupted
                  availability is not technically feasible. We therefore do not
                  guarantee disruption-free operation or a specific level of
                  availability. In particular, we may restrict access without
                  providing reasons - in whole or in part, temporarily or
                  permanently. In addition, no claims shall exist regarding the
                  maintenance of individual functionalities of the layers app.
                  We are entitled at any time to change or remove content,
                  services and functionalities that are provided within the app
                  and to make new content, services and functionalities

                  transfer the rights and obligations under these Terms, we will
                  inform you in writing about the transfer; you are then
